*****  MAMERun beta 6 source Readme  September 7, 2000  *****

This is a VisProRexx project folder.  For those of you who have
VisProRexx, you should be able to make changes just like in
any other project.  For people who don't have VisProRexx, you
should be able to view the Rexx code in plain text.  I have also
included a build of the source.  If you have any suggestions for
updates or improvements I encourage you to send them to me for
possible merge into the "Official" build which will be maintained
at http://home1.gte.net/stefanj/. This program, it's source, and all
future changes will be opensourced. Please read the file
License.txt for particulars.


Have fun!
