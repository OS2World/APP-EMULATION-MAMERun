    License:

    The intent of this license is to grant you and others the maximum rights possible to the software covered by
    it, while also minimizing the potential for compatibility issues. 
    Section I: Definitions: 
  
    "Software" is the software that is covered by this license.  This includes source code, binary, and all other
    files. 
      
    "Owner" is the Software's copyright owner. 
  
    "Program" is anything you create using this software, including standalone programs, operating systems,
    and shared or static libraries. 
      
    "Unaltered Version" is an exact duplicate of the Software as provided by the Owner.  If you add to, delete,
    or change any files in the Software package, or if you add files to the Software, it is no longer an Unaltered
    Version. 
  
    "Altered Version" is either a copy of the Software's source code that has been modified by someone other
    than the Owner, or the binary portion of a Program built with modified source code.  This includes a
    modified copy of the Software built into a statically or dynamically linked library, unlinked object file, or
    standalone application. 
  
    Section II: Scenarios and Requirements 
  
    Scenario: You want to distribute an Unaltered Copy of the Software. 
    Requirements: None. 
  
    Scenario: You want to use an Unaltered Copy of the Software to create your Program. 
    Requirements: None. 
  
    Scenario: You want to distribute an Altered Version of the Software. 
    Requirements: 
  
    1. You must provide as part of your Program an Unaltered Copy of the Software or provide, as part of your
    Program's documentation, a method for members of the general public to obtain an Unaltered Copy of the
    Software for no more than a trivial cost.
  
    2. You must provide as part of your Program the modifications to the Software in the form of source code
    patches, at most one patch file for any source code file, which can be applied to the Unaltered Version of
    the Software mentioned in (1) to produce the source for the Altered Version.
  
    3. The patches mentioned in (2) must not rely on any tool or resource that isn't publicly available to anyone
    developing for the hardware and software platform your Program or the Altered Version requires. 
  
    4. The source code to your modifications mentioned in (2) must be covered by this license. 
  
    5. You must grant the Owner a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use, modify, and redistribute your
    modifications in future Unaltered Versions of the Software and other projects, provided those projects are
    covered by this or another widely recognized open source license. 
  
    6. Your modifications must not remove or alter the copyright notices, this license, or any other intellectual
    property or ownership statements in the Software as distributed by the Owner.
  
    Section III: Limitations 
  
    The Software is provided "as is" and without any express or implied warranties, including, without limitation,
    the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose.   The Owner is not liable for
    any damages or other costs incurred by you by using the Software. 
  
    You are granted the rights described in Section II provided you comply with all the requirements for each of
    the applicable scenarios listed in that Section and the rest of this document.  If you cannot or are unwilling
    to meet all the requirements for your desired use of the Software, then you are not granted a license to use
    or distribute the Software, and you should contact the Owner t reach an agreement.
